# CherryBuilder

Welcome to *CherryBuilder - The productivity extension for C++Builder*

---

Here you will find the complete sources for a new code completion implementation approach
for _C++Builder®_, based on _Universal Ctags_.

It has been developed with C++Builder 10.2 _Tokyo_ but should be usable with any more-or-less recent version.

It's main intention was, to replace C++Builder's notoriously sluggish and buggy _CodeInsight_ by
something completely independant written from scratch.

Originally I had planned to finish the development some day and offer this as a paid plugin. But for
various reasons, I can't and will not pursue this project further and therefore release it in it's
current **unfinished** state under the MIT Open Source license for everyone interested in it.

Maybe **you** are the one completing it or writing another extension for C++Builder or RAD Studio so
the sources would help you as well.

Have fun with this code and make something usable of it, but keep in mind that this while thing isn't
even in _Alpha_ state and that I definitely **won't invest time in it any further**.

🍺 Cheers!!
