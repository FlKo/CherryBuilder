# CherryBuilder

Welcome to *CherryBuilder - The productivity extension for C++Builder*

---

Here you will find the complete sources for a new code completion implementation approach
for _C++Builder®_, based on [Universal Ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags).

It's main intention was, to replace C++Builder's notoriously sluggish and buggy _CodeInsight_ completion
engine with something completely independent written with C++Builder 10.2 _Tokyo_ from scratch
(but should be usable with any other more-or-less recent version).

Originally I had planned to finish the development some day and offer this as a paid plugin. This is
also the reason why each invocation of _Ctags_ is done by running it's compiled executable: To
comply with it's GPL licensing terms while keeping me the possibility of monetizing CherryBuilder.

You can also take a look at [this explanation video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsiCn9NCC0o)
I made for some promotional aspects.

The sources and compiled binaries of the version of _Universal Ctags_ used with CherryBuilder are
also available in this repository.
 
For various reasons, I can't and will not pursue this project any further and therefore release it
in it's current **unfinished** state under the MIT license for everyone interested in it.

Maybe **you** are the one who completes it or writes another extension for C++Builder or RAD Studio
where the sources may help you, too.

Have fun with the code and make something useful of it, but keep in mind that the whole thing isn't
even in an _Alpha_ state and that I definitely **won't invest time in it any further**.

🍺 Cheers!!

Note: CherryBuilder borrows some icons from [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
which is also available under the MIT license.
